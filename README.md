# Spring Framework Demo

This is a GitHub repository I created while learning Spring Framework. This repository contains information about the basic configuration of a Spring application and the libraries used.

## Configuration

The project includes the following configuration files:

- `application.properties`: A properties file that contains application configuration.
- `logback.xml`: An XML file that configures logging using the Logback library.

## Used Libraries

The project uses the following libraries:

- Spring Framework: The main library used for Spring application development.
- Spring Boot: A tool used to quickly bootstrap and configure Spring-based applications.
- Spring Data JPA: An integration of the Java Persistence API (JPA) that simplifies database operations.
- Hibernate: A library used for object-relational mapping (ORM) operations.
- Logback: A logging framework used for logging operations.
- Lombok: A library used to simplify and enhance Java classes.

## How to Run

Since the project is a Spring Boot application, you can follow these steps to run it:

1. Clone the project repository to your computer.
2. Open the project using a Java IDE (such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).
3. Locate the `DemoApplication.java` class within the project and run it.
4. Once the application is successfully started, you can view it by accessing `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.
